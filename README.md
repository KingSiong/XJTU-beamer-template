# XJTU-beamer-template

this is a beamer template used for presentation for students in xjtu. preview [here](http://www.kingsiong.top/document/slide.pdf).

this is modified from [Uppsala University Beamer Template v2.0](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uppsala-university-beamer-template-v2-dot-0/sjbwbmzvpbbf). 

i barely changed anything. the main work i have done is just changing the pics of logo.

thanks and have fun. :)
