# XJTU-beamer-template

this is a beamer template used for presentation for students in xjtu. 

this is modified from [Uppsala University Beamer Template v2.0](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uppsala-university-beamer-template-v2-dot-0/sjbwbmzvpbbf). 

i barely changed anything. the main work what i have done is just changing the pics of logo. i would like to change the main color but xjtured is ... awful, so i gave it up.

thanks and have fun. :)
